# Blackjack Game

## Description
This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game allows a user to play against a computer dealer, following the basic rules of Blackjack.

## Features
- The game randomly deals two cards to both the user and the computer.
- The player can choose to draw another card or pass.
- The computer follows standard Blackjack rules:
  - It draws a card if its total is below 17.
  - It may randomly decide to draw in certain situations.
- Aces (11) are automatically adjusted to 1 if the total exceeds 21.
- The game determines the winner based on standard Blackjack scoring.
- The player can choose to play multiple rounds.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. You will receive two cards, and the dealer will receive one visible card.
3. If either you or the dealer gets a Blackjack (21 with two cards), the game ends immediately.
4. If no one has a Blackjack, you can choose to draw another card (`y`) or pass (`n`).
5. The dealer will then play based on their total.
6. The winner is determined based on the final totals:
   - The highest total under or equal to 21 wins.
   - If both totals are equal, it's a draw.
   - If your total exceeds 21, you lose.
   - If the dealer's total exceeds 21, you win.
7. You will be asked if you want to play again.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- No external libraries required (uses the built-in `random` module)

## Running the Game
Run the script using:
```sh
python blackjack.py
```

## Notes
- The game follows simplified Blackjack rules without betting or splitting.
- Ensure you enter valid inputs (`y` or `n`) when prompted.

## Future Improvements
- Add betting mechanics.
- Implement a graphical interface.
- Improve the dealer's AI for more strategic gameplay.
